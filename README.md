# JavaScript_Quiz

This is a quiz that will begin when you press on the button that first appears.

This quiz will then begin at 45 seconds and count down while you go over multiple choice questions.

If the correct answer is selected for the multiple choice question the next question with choices are rendered. If not the timer has 15 seconds subtracted from it.

If the time runs out or the player reaches the maximum score the game is over.

When the game is over a series of prompts appear stating the game is over, the users score, and asking for initials to be stored alongside the score.

The score is logged to local memory along with the players initials and the page reloads to start the quiz anew.
